# Carbon Hack 24: Code Green

The following guide details how to run the Code Green solution. 

We present a Kubernetes Impact Engine Metrics application that we believe will expand the uses of the Impact Framework to real-time metric access. Our application deployment architecture consists of Kubernetes(K8s), Prometheus and Grafana applications which communicate through our custom K8s Impact Engine Metrics Application.

![CodeGreen_AppDeploymentArchitecture_NoHeading](https://github.com/nb-green-ops/carbon-hack-24/assets/136962406/f66346f9-5e91-426b-90e1-d7fad1ed2be9)

### Set up local environment

For a local deployment and evaluation the following is assumed about the environment:

- It is based on Unix ( This is for the build script, running `docker build .` on Windows should work as well. See step 3)
- It has docker installed, and contains a local k8s cluster.
- the kubectl comaandline utility is installed.

It is also possible to deploy to a hosted k8s service, but that requires also having access to a container registry.


### 1. Get started with a Kubernetes Cluster

To run the Code Green project solution, you will need Kubernetes and Docker Desktop installed, with admin access.

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

Once these are running in the background, install the metrics server.  

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```

Install the default Prometheus operator and Grafana stack. For more information see user guide [here](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/user-guides/getting-started/)

We make use of [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus.git), a tool that allows us to use Prometheus to monitor Kubernetes and applications running on Kubernetes.

Clone this in a new and seperate directory, outside of CARBON-HACK-24.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus.git
```

In the new `kube-prometheus` repositorie's root directory, run the following commands:

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side -f manifests/setup
kubectl wait \ 
--for condition=Established \
--all CustomResourceDefinition \
--namespace=monitoring
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```
This will create all the nececary CRD's and resources for the kube-prometheus stack and may take a few seccond to somplete.

### 2. Create a service account

Create a service account for the metrics reader by running `kubectl apply -f .k8s/sa.yml` from the root of the repository.

```sh
kubectl apply -f .k8s/sa.yml
```

Create a token for the service account, ensure its for an extended duration.

```sh
kubectl -n default create token metrics-reader-sa --duration 999999h
```

Replace the token and kubernetes (k8s) host url located in `server/ie/cluster.yml` and replace with your own values specific to your kubernetes cluster. 
Note that the k8s host url will be different if your cluster is hosted on Azure or AWS.
However for local KIND clusters the value should be `https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443`.

```yml
name: k8s-metrics-importer-example
description: k8s-metrics-importer-example
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    if-k8s-metrics-importer:
      method: K8sMetricsImporter
      path: "https://github.com/nb-green-ops/if-k8s-metrics-importer"
      global-config:
        token: [REPLACE WITH YOUR CLUSTER TOKEN]
        k8s-host-url: [REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN HOST URL]
```

**[Optional] Modify default metrics**: For more accurate readings, you can replace the default metrics in `server/ie/cluster.yml` by adding values applicable to your cluster.

| Metric                      | Description                                                                                               | Example          |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| device/emissions-embodied  | Total greenhouse gases emitted during the production, transport, and disposal of the device.              | 1533.120 gCO2eq  |
| time-reserved               | Time reserved for some process or task.                                                                   | 15 seconds       |
| device/expected-lifespan   | Expected lifespan of the device.                                                                          | 94608000 seconds |
| resources-reserved          | Number of units of some resource that are reserved.                                                       | 1                |
| resources-total             | Total number of units of some resource.                                                                   | 1                |
| grid/carbon-intensity       | Amount of CO2 emissions produced per unit of electricity consumed.                                       | 800              |
| cpu/thermal-design-power    | Amount of heat a CPU is expected to emit under maximum load, measured in watts.                           | 30 watts         |

### 3. Build the container

Execute the following `./scripts/build.sh` file to build the container. Ensure to run this in the root directory of the carbon-hack-24 repo.

```sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

Please note you may need to push this file to a registry if you're running on an external cluster (e.g. AKS, EKS or a custom kubernetes cluster).

### 4. Update the deployment files for your container

Create a namespace on the cluster using the provided yaml file `.k8s/common/namespace.yml`. Update it if you feel the need but be sure to also update all deployments of the app as well. 

```yml
kind: Namespace 
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: carbon-hack-24 # maybe update this
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: carbon-hack-24 # maybe update this
```

Create the namespace:
```sh
kubectl apply -f .k8s/common/namespace.yml
```

Once the namespace has been created, apply the `.k8s/common/deployment-app.yml` file to deploy the app.

Create the namespace:
```sh
kubectl apply -f .k8s/common/deployment-app.yml
```

* Ensure that the namespace references match the namespace created with the `.k8s/common/namespace.yml` file.

* Replace the image name with your containers details if you changed the build script prior to this step.
* Make sure to prepend with the associated registry if you are deploying to a hosted k8s cluster that is pulling from a registry.

```yml
containers:
        - name: carbon-hack-24-app
          env:
            - name: NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED # This value is here to ignore certificates, in the case where you are using test clusters and certs
              value: "0"                         # It is highly reccomended to not set this in any production case and import the propper root certs to your container
          image: 'ch24/prom-exporter-server:latest' # update this
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

### 5. Connect to Prometheus

Once the application is up and running, we can apply a scrape config to let Prometheus know to scrape our app.

Apply the `.k8s/scrape-config.yml` file which will scrape the metrics for Prometheus.

```sh
kubectl apply -f scrape-config.yml
```

If you made changes in the `.k8s/common/deployment-app.yml` file, check that the targets referenced in the `.k8s/scrape-config.yml` file are correct.

```yml
spec:
  staticConfigs:
    - labels:
        job: carbon-hack-24-app
      targets:
        - carbon-hack-24-app.carbon-hack-24:4040 # Check this
```

### 6. Connect to Grafana dashboard

If you are running your project locally, you will need to port-forward Grafana in order to access it. This allows the kubernetes to expose the grafana instance to your local host.

```sh
kubectl --namespace monitoring port-forward svc/grafana 4300:3000
```

Alternatively, if your project is running externally on kubernetes, an ingress will need to be deployed and configured apropriately.

### 7. Launch Grafana dashboard

At last, time to launch the grafana dashboard. Remembering the port we exposed Grafana on, we can open the following url in a browser: [`http://localhost:4300/`](http://localhost:4300/).

The default admin credentials for Grafana:
* Username: admin
* Password: admin

## [Optional] Use our template for your Grafana dashboard

Make use of our default json file for your emission dashboard, located in the `k8s/docs/default-green-dash.json` file. 

Using K8s metrics from the cluster, we provide a sum of the total SCI and map according to the cluster location.

### 8. Set up alerts

To modify the alert system, select the chart of interest. We have created a default alert for illustration, see the red box below.

![image](https://github.com/nb-green-ops/carbon-hack-24/assets/136962406/9124535f-dce8-4aef-baf1-81b035860806)

Select the alert and modify the alert name, query and alert condition. 

![image](https://github.com/nb-green-ops/carbon-hack-24/assets/136962406/1b8e422e-04a5-4180-9e4f-28d73a86e924)

Set threshold for alert to be triggered (currently set to trigger alert above 700).

Note that for now, this is all we need. Leave other alert rule values as default.

Save and run the query.
